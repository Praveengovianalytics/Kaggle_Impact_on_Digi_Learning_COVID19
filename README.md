Kaggle Competition - Impact on Digital Learning due to COVID 19 


# Problem Statement
The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among Americaâ€™s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.

# Challenge
We challenge the Kaggle community to explore (1) the state of digital learning in 2020 and (2) how the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.

We encourage you to guide the analysis with questions that are related to the themes that are described above (in bold font). Below are some examples of questions that relate to our problem statement:

1. What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?
2. What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?
3. How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?
4. How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)?    Learning context? Socioeconomic status?
5. Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?
